# Messages

Address Finder uses a small default set of messages to communicate specific events to the user. All of Address Finder's default messages can be overridden. They are outlined below:

## Initial Message

`msgInitial`

Displays when the Address Finder is opened and the input field is empty.

Defaults to `"Start typing to find address"`

## Accessibility (Screen Reader) Message

`msgList`

The aria-label assigned to the address suggestion list. This message will only be picked up by screen readers.

Defaults to `"Select your address"`

## No Match

`msgNoMatch`

Displays when no suggestions could be found for the query.

Defaults to `"No matches found"`

## Unhide Label

`msgUnhide`

Displayed to the user if Address Fields have been hidden. It is shown as a clickable element to trigger manual address entry.

Defaults to `"Enter address manually"`

## Fallback Message

`msgFallback`

Shown when Address Finder is unable to provide suggestions for any reason (e.g. key is not available).

Defaults to `"Please enter your address manually"`

> Bear in mind these messages are also important for users who rely on the screen reader. When altering the message, be sure that the necessary meaning and intent are understandable to visually impaired users who will be getting audio cues from their screen reader.
