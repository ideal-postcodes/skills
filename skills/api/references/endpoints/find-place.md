# Find Place

**Endpoint:** `GET /places`

**Operation ID:** `FindPlace`

**Tags:** Place Search

Query for geographical places across countries. Each query will return a list of place suggestions, which consists of a place name, descriptive name and id.

This API returns geographical information such as countries, capitals, administrative areas and more. It is ideal for correctly identifying a place along with any other details like geolocation.

## Implementing Place Autocomplete

Extracting the full information of a place is a 2 step process:

1. Retrieve place suggestions via /places
2. Retrieve the entire place with the ID provided in the suggestion

## Suggestion Format

Each place suggestion contains a descriptive name which you can provide to users to uniquely identify a place.

## Rate Limiting and Cost

The rate limit for the Autocomplete API is 3000 requests per 5 minutes. HTTP Headers inform about the current rate limit.

Autocomplete API usage does not impact your balance, but resolving a suggestion to a full address requires a paid request. Autocomplete requests without subsequent paid requests may result in rate limitation or suspension.
