# Find Address

**Endpoint:** `GET /autocomplete/addresses`

**Operation ID:** `FindAddress`

**Tags:** Address Search

The Address Autocomplete API delivers address suggestions in order of relevance based on a provided query. It aids real-time address autofill implementations.

Consider using our Address Autocomplete JavaScript libraries to add address lookup to a form in moments rather than interacting with this API directly.

## API Usage

Implementing our Address Autocomplete API involves:

1. Fetch address suggestions with `/autocomplete/addresses`
2. Acquire the complete address using the ID from the suggestion

Step 2 will decrement your lookup balance.

Note that step 1 is not a free standalone resource. Integrations that consistently make autocomplete requests without a paid Step 2 request will be rate limited and then suspended.

## Query Filters

Refine results by appending filters to your querystring, e.g., `postcode=sw1a2aa` for postcode `SW1A 2AA`. Invalid filters return an empty set without affecting your lookup count.

To apply multiple filter terms, use a comma-separated list, e.g., `postcode_outward=e1,e2,e3` combines result sets for E1, E2, and E3. Unless otherwise specified, all filters support multiple terms.

Combine filters by `AND` logic, for instance, `su_organisation_indicator=Y&postcode_area=n`. The maximum allowed filter terms is **10**.

## Address Bias

Preface bias searches with `bias_` to boost certain address results. Unlike filters, biasing allows unmatched addresses to appear with lower priority.

For example, use `bias_postcode_area=SW,SE` to favour addresses in the `SW` and `SE` postcode areas. Invalid bias terms have no effect.

Multiple bias terms are allowed unless stated otherwise, with a combined maximum of **5**.

## Suggestion Format

The suggestion format is subject to change. We recommend using the suggestion as-is to prevent potential integration issues.

## Rate Limiting and Cost

The rate limit for the Autocomplete API is 3000 requests per 5 minutes. HTTP Headers inform about the current rate limit.

Autocomplete API usage does not impact your balance, but resolving a suggestion to a full address requires a paid request. Autocomplete requests without subsequent paid requests may result in rate limitation or suspension.
