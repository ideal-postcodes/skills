These are assigned to one single address either due to the large volume of mail received at that address, or because a PO Box or Selectapost service has been set up. Small User Postcodes.

Once the Delivery Point is deleted from PAF the DPS may be reused (although they aren’t reused until all remaining Delivery Points in the range have been allocated). The DPS for a Large User is always '1A' as each Large User has its own Postcode. | `1A` |
| `premise` | yes | string | A pre-computed string which sensibly combines building_number, building_name and sub_building_name. building_number, building_name and sub_building_name represent raw data from Royal Mail's and can be difficult to parse if you are unaware of how the Postcode Address File premise fields work together. For this reason, we also provide a pre-computed premise field which intelligently gathers these points into a single, simple premise string. This field is ideal if you want to pull premise information and thoroughfare information separately instead of using our address lines data. | `10` |
