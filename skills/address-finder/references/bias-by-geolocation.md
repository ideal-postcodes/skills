# Bias By Geolocation

Bias search to a geospatial circle determined by an origin and radius in meters. Max radius is `50000`.

Uses the format `bias_lonlat=[longitude],[latitude],[radius in metres]`. Only one geospatial bias may be provided

In the example below, a geolocation bias is set to prioritize addresses near "10 Downing St".

```html
<form style="max-width: 450px; padding: 10px;">
    <label for="line_1">Address First Line</label>
    <input type="text" id="line_1" />
    <label for="line_2">Address Second Line</label>
    <input type="text" id="line_2" />
    <label for="line_3">Address Third Line</label>
    <input type="text" id="line_3" />
    <label for="post_town">Town or City</label>
    <input type="text" id="post_town" />
    <label for="postcode">Postcode</label>
    <input type="text" id="postcode" />
</form>
```

```javascript
  import { AddressFinder } from "@ideal-postcodes/address-finder";

  AddressFinder.setup({
    apiKey: "ak_test",
    queryOptions: {
      // Set geolocation bias to 10 Downing St
      bias_lonlat: "-0.1276,51.5034,100",
    },
    outputFields: {
      line_1: "#line_1",
      line_2: "#line_2",
      line_3: "#line_3",
      post_town: "#post_town",
      postcode: "#postcode",
    },
  });
```
